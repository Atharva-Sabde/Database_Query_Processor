# Database_Query_Processor
This is an interactive sql query processor , made from scratch using Java Swing ,and JDBC api.



## ================   Preparation   ================

There are two methods to add and connect the JDBC jar files.

- Paste it in the 'ext'  folder of jre.( will work globally , but if the project is moved to another machine , program won't run, as the JAR file could be missing on the other machine.)
- Make new folder  'lib' inside each Project of eclipse and build path. ( specific to the parent project , but moves with the project [mobility] , and run on any machine )
